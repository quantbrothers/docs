# Framework gateway FIX API
message which represents 


## Workflow

After connecting and logging on, the client can either request a security list or subscribe to market data.

Server does not resend messages on a market data channel. Instead, Server will send a `Sequence Reset <4>` message with `GapFillFlag <123>` field set to Y and the new sequence number in the `MsgSeqNum <34>` field.


**Security list**

Optional: Server offers a security list that supplies the definitive list of symbols traded on the exchange.

1. Client sends a `Security List Request <x>`
2. Server responds with a `Security List <y>`


**Market data subscription**

After connecting to the the market data channel, the client subscribes to market data by sending a `Market Data Request <V>` message.

When a client disconnects for any reason, the market data subscription is terminated. Upon reconnecting, the client needs to send another `Market Data Request <V>` message.

1. Client sends a `Market Data Request <V>`
2. Server responds by sending one Market Data - `Snapshot/Full Refresh <W>`
3. As bids, offers, trades and/or auctions happen on the exchange, Server sends Market Data - `Incremental Refresh <X>` messages

*.*FIX 4.4 EP 26 is used to backport MDEntryType (269) = Q Auction Clearing Price to denote indicative and final auction prices.*


## Logon < A> message

The `Logon <A>` message must be the first message sent by the application requesting to initiate a FIX session. The `Logon <A>` message authenticates an institution establishing a connection to Server.

Tag|Name|Req|Description
---|----|---|-----------
98|EncryptMethod|Y|Server does not support encryption. Valid values: 0 = None.
108|HeartBtInt|Y|`Heartbeat <0>` message interval (seconds).
141|ResetSeqNumFlag|N|Indicates that the both sides of the FIX session should reset sequence numbers. Valid values: Y = Yes, reset sequence numbers N = No.


## Logout < 5> message

The `Logout <5>` message initiates or confirms the termination of a FIX session. Disconnection without the exchange of `Logout <5>` messages should be interpreted as an abnormal condition.


## New Order Single < D> message

To submit a new order to server, send a `New Order Single <D>` message.Server will respond to a `New Order Single <D>` message with an `Execution Report <8>`.

>For lib Quickfix

```csharp
 NewOrderSingle newOrderSingle = new NewOrderSingle(
                clOrdId,

## Reject < 3> message

**Description**

The `Reject <3>` message should be issued when a message is received but cannot be properly processed due to a session-level rule violation. An example of when a reject may be appropriate would be the receipt of a message with invalid basic data (e.g. `MsgType <35>`=&) which successfully passes de-encryption, `CheckSum <10>` and `BodyLength <9>` checks. As a rule, messages should be forwarded to the trading application for business level rejections whenever possible.
<br><br>Rejected messages should be logged and the incoming sequence number incremented.
<br><br>Note: The receiving application should disregard any message that is garbled, cannot be parsed or fails a data integrity check. Processing of the next valid FIX message will cause detection of a sequence gap and a `Resend Request <2>` will be generated. Logic should be included in the FIX engine to recognize the possible infinite resend loop, which may be encountered in this situation.
<br><br>Generation and receipt of a `Reject <3>` message indicates a serious error that may be the result of faulty logic in either the sending or receiving application.
<br><br>If the sending application chooses to retransmit the rejected message, it should be assigned a new sequence number and sent with `PossResend <97>`=Y.
<br><br>Whenever possible, it is strongly recommended that the cause of the failure be described in the `Text <58>` field (e.g. INVALID DATA - FIELD 35).
<br><br>If an application-level message received fulfills session-level rules, it should then be processed at a business message-level. If this processing detects a rule violation, a business-level reject should be issued. Many business-level messages have specific "reject" messages, which should be used. All others can be rejected at a business-level via the `Business Message Reject <j>` message. See Volume 1: "`Business Message Reject <j>`" message.
<br><br>Note that in the event a business message is received, fulfills session-level rules, however, the message cannot be communicated to the business-level processing system, a `Business Message Reject <j>` with `BusinessRejectReason <380>` = "Application not available at this time" should be issued.

**Scenarios for session-level `Reject <3>`:**
<br>`SessionRejectReason <373>`
<br>0 Invalid tag number
<br>1 Required tag missing
<br>2 Tag not defined for this message type
<br>3 Undefined Tag
<br>4 Tag specified without a value
<br>5 Value is incorrect (out of range) for this tag
<br>6 Incorrect data format for value
<br>7 Decryption problem
<br>8 `Signature <89>` problem
<br>9 CompID problem
<br>10 `SendingTime <52>` accuracy problem
<br>11 Invalid `MsgType <35>`
<br>12 XML Validation error
<br>13 Tag appears more than once
<br>14 Tag specified out of required order
<br>15 Repeating group fields out of order
<br>16 Incorrect NumInGroup count for repeating group
<br>17 Non "data" value includes field delimiter (SOH character)
<br>99 Other
<br><br>*(Note other session-level rule violations may exist in which case `SessionRejectReason <373>` of Other may be used and further information may be in `Text <58>` field.)*
